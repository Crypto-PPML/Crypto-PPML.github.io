## Affiliated Event: The 3rd Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning Workshop 2021

### About

Artificial intelligence is progressing rapidly. Systems based on machine learning algorithms approach and sometimes even exceed the abilities of human experts. Applications of machine learning involve almost every aspect of our lives, from health care and DNA sequence classification, to financial markets, computer networks and many more. Machine learning algorithms perform better when being exposed to more and more data, but such data is not always accessible due to privacy constraints. Can we train machine learning algorithms on confidential data without ever being exposed to it? Can my model classify your sample without ever seeing it?

The workshop aims to strengthen collaborations among the machine learning and cryptography communities. The scope includes privacy preserving techniques for training, inference, and disclosure. The workshop will consist of few invited talks, together with contributed talks.

### Abstracts -- Invited Speakers

#### **Yuval Ishai:** New Techniques for Efficient Secure Computation
**Abstract:**
The explosive growth of interest in privacy-preserving ML motivates new techniques for efficient secure computation. In this talk I will survey recent techniques that were developed in the context of general-purpose secure computation but can be particularly appealing for ML-related applications:

- Using function secret sharing for fast secure computation of simple nonlinear functions in an offline-online setting. This applies in particular to ReLU and other popular activation functions;

- Using pseudorandom correlation generators for "silent" secure generation of useful sources of correlated randomness, including random oblivious transfers and (authenticated) multiplication triples;

- Using fully linear zero-knowledge proof systems for practical "semi-honest to malicious" compilers with sublinear additive communication overhead.

#### **Nicolas Papernot:**  What can we learn from cryptography to develop more trustworthy ML?

**Abstract:**
The attack surface of machine learning is large: training data can be poisoned, predictions manipulated using adversarial examples, models exploited to reveal sensitive information contained in training data, etc. This is in large parts due to the absence of security and privacy considerations in the design of ML algorithms. In this talk, we show that by drawing inspiration from ideas common in the crypto community, we can make principled progress towards more trustworthy ML. We will give examples including work on data privacy, model ownership, and integrity verification for the training algorithm.



### Call for Contributed Talks

There will be a session of contributed talks. Since the conference is on zoom, the contributed talks will be shorter this year (10 minutes at most).

We encourage submissions exploring a range of techniques and applications for privacy preserving machine learning, including, but not limited to:

- Multiparty computation
- Homomorphic encryption
- Differential privacy
- Adversarial machine learning
- Model stealing
- Fairness and accountability
- Federated Learning
- Synthetic data generation




**Submission site:**
The submission site is available [here](https://secure.iacr.org/websubrev/ppml2021/submit/)

**Submission deadline:**
Thursday, July 22nd, 2021, 11:59pm EST.


**Notifications:**
Sunday, August 1st, 2021.



Submissions must comply with the following rules:
- We encourage submitting full papers. Abstracts can also be provided.
- Submissions must be non-anonymous and must clearly specify which author will give the talk.
- The submission should provide sufficient detail to explain what the talk will be about.
- As the workshop does not have formal proceedings, we accept contributed talk proposals which correspond to papers that are under submission or already published elsewhere (parallel submissions are allowed).

The committee will follow COI standards according to the IACR policy. Contributed Talks Committee members are allowed to submit as well.
